Corporate Experience
--------------------

Since 2014 Jan (1 Year 3 months)
:   *Data Engineer for [AdNear](https://adnear.com/)*
    (Bangalore, India).

    User Profiling: Worked on a simple rule based location oriented user segmentation project. Involved in reducing time complexity of the profiling algorithm, by basically reducing the search space. Responsible for 
    - querying different Places API to build Location to appropriate Point of interest(s) database.
    - Identifying new place categories for the rule based segmentation approach. 
    - updating profiled users to a lookup table
    Used Hive, Hadoop, Java
    Worked on a prototype algorithm to cluster users by using their location (where the person is), App used (what the person is doing), time (Using the person's local time). 
    Used Hadoop, Java, Python

    Log Ingestion: One of the developers for a full fledged Log ingestion system built at AdNear. The project is responsible for absorbing unremitting log messages from message queues, and storing them to a central store.
    Used Java, Python

2013 Sep-2013 Nov (4 months)
:   *Associate Data Engineer for
    [DeltaX](http://www.deltax.com/)* (Bangalore, India).

    Re-targeting Platform: Here worked on a simple retargetting platform built with DynamoDB and Node.js. The former is used to store the user cookie id and at max 6 latest products s/he has visited on a client e-commerce site. There after whenever the person visits any website, the targeted products are shown as ads.


    Real time data visualization: Worked on a prototype using node.js, syslog-ng, Kafka, Storm, MongoDB. syslog-ng is used to emit server events as logs, stored on Kafka queue, and are ultimately processed by storm, and are saved to a MongoDB collection.

2012 Jul-2013 Jul (1 year)
:   *Internship at [Verisign Inc](http://www.verisigninc.com/)*
    (Bangalore, India). Verisign Inc is registry of .com and .ned domains

    Internet Profiling Service: This Biggie at Verisigninc is used to crawl all of the .com and .net domains(once in every month) to collect various kinds of information. Worked in bits and parts of Address extraction from a possible contact-us page. Responsible for making improvements to website classification algorithms. 

    Clustering web pages(home pages): It is my Masters thesis project. It is basically a project on information filtering umberella. Used to identify the exactly the same kind of web pages(mirror pages) with only change in website name or Hostname. It was built as Hadoop project, to understand the concept of Mapreduce. The project crawls the home pages of websites given, extract HTML templates, creating murmur hashes, using the hashes at reducer to collect similar websites. 

    Analysis of social sharing habits: The project listens to the external social networking APIs like Twitter and Bitly to identify phrases, that are trending, and analyse how the domain name registrations are influenced.
